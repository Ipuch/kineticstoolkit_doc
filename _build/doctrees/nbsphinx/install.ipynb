    "Kinetics Toolkit is distributed via both [conda-forge](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/kineticstoolkit) and [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/kineticstoolkit). The source code is hosted on [git-hub](https://github.com/felixchenier/kineticstoolkit).\n",
    "\n",
    "Since reading c3d files relies on [ezc3d](https://github.com/pyomeca/ezc3d) which binaries are distributed only via conda-forge, the recommended installation method is therefore using conda-forge.\n",

    "Install a conda distribution\n",
    "----------------------------\n",

    "Download and install Anaconda or [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) with python 3.8 or newer.\n",

    "Create a ktk environment\n",
    "------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "It is recommended to create a separate environment, at least for testing Kinetics Toolkit. Open an Anaconda Prompt (on Windows) or a terminal (on macOS and Linux) and type these commands one by one to create a `ktk` virtual environment and install Kinetics Toolkit in this environment.\n",

    "You can keep Kinetics Toolkit up to date by typing this command regularly:\n",

    "Kinetics Toolkit's interactive functions make use of IPython's integration of Matplotlib/Qt5's event loop. When you want to use interactive functions in IPython, type:\n",

    "Alternatively, since the Spyder IDE is so oriented towards science and it uses IPython, I highly suggest using this development environment. To use Spyder and configure it for interactive graphics:\n",

    "- Download and install the standalone version of [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org) (now recommended by Spyder's developers over installing it from conda).\n",
    "- [Configure Spyder's environment](https://docs.spyder-ide.org/current/faq.html#using-existing-environment) to use the ktk conda environment you just created.\n",
    "- Choose the Qt5 backend for IPython:\n",
    "    - Go to the Spyder's preferences, to the **IPython console** item, then to the **Graphics** pane.\n",
