    "**Step 3.** We express a series of homogeneous transforms between the proximal and distal frames (how the distal segment is oriented in space compared to the proximal segment);\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 4.** We extract the series of Euler angles from these homogeneous transforms (what series of three angles allow such relative orientation);\n",
