# ðŸš§ Extracting angles

:::{card} Summary
This ongoing section will show how to extract Euler/Cardan angles from homogeneous transforms, and more specifically why rotation order is so important. It will also introduce Kinetics Toolkit's [ktk.geometry.get_angles](api/ktk.geometry.get_angles.rst) function.
