# How to contribute

We remind the objectives of the project:

- Building an intuitive and elegant Python package that leverages the power of biomechanical analysis to people who are not formed in programming or engineering;

- Building a strong documentation around this package to:
    - Teach python basics for biomechanical research;
    - Teach or remind the basic principles of biomechanics;
    - Explain how Kinetics Toolkit implements these principles; 

At the moment, I think Kinetics Toolkit has made a moderate way into its first objective. There is however still much to do. If you find this long-term project appealing and want to contribute, here are different ways to help:

- Try it and tell me your thoughts and ideas on the interface, features and documentation;
- Test it and report bugs;
- Communicate with me to help with documentation;
- Extend it to develop missing functionality and share the results;
- Citing it in your work;
- Possibly many other ways to help.

A good start would be to clone and start playing with the master branch on [GitHub](https://github.com/felixchenier/kineticstoolkit).

The following sections are resources to help helping:
