- Comments
- Docstrings
    - Use Spyder's help browser or "function_name?" to see the docstring
- Good practice with Docstrings
    - Docstring your main file, before even starting to code. Describe what you have as data, and the form of your final data after the processing you want to do.
    - This is a must and we will return often to this good practice.
