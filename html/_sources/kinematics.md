# Kinematics analysis

:::{card} Summary
In the following sections, we will use the [](api/ktk.Player.rst) class and the [](api/ktk.kinematics.rst) module to visualize and process real-life acquisitions of 3d markers, to calculate a series of joint angles, and to reconstruct virtual markers using different methods such as calibration markers or probing.
