# Kinematics analysis

The [](api/ktk.kinematics.rst) module is a higher level module that is specific to kinematic analysis. Along with the [](api/ktk.Player.rst) class, it allows opening and viewing trajectories of markers from 3D acquisition files, creating point clusters, reconstructing occluded or missing markers, and then processing those trajectories using the lower-level [](api/ktk.geometry.rst) module (e.g., generating local coordinate systems, calculating joint angles).

In the following tutorials, we will process real-life acquisitions of 3d markers and process those markers to reconstruct virtual markers and calculate joint angles.
