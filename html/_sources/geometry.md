# 3D rigid body geometry

:::{card} Summary

The [](api/ktk.geometry.rst) module simplifies the calculation of linear algebric operations on series of points, vectors and transformation matrices.

In the following tutorials, we will review rigid body basics (points, vectors, frames, homogeneous transforms), how to navigate between frames and local/global coordinates, and how to extract rotation angles from a series of rigid transforms. Such understanding is required to understand the [](api/ktk.kinematics.rst) module, which will be presented in the section after.
