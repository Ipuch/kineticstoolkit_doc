# 3D rigid body geometry

:::{card} Summary
This section introduces the [](api/ktk.geometry.rst) module that simplifies the calculation of linear algebric operations on series of points, vectors and transformation matrices.
:::

In the following sections, we will review rigid body basics (points, vectors, frames, homogeneous transforms), how to navigate between frames and local/global coordinates, and how to extract rotation angles from a series of rigid transforms. Such understanding is required to understand the [](api/ktk.kinematics.rst) module that is presented in the section after.

Then, we will use the [](api/ktk.Player.rst) class and the [](api/ktk.kinematics.rst) module to visualize and process real-life acquisitions of 3d markers, to calculate a series of joint angles, and to reconstruct virtual markers using different methods such as calibration markers or probing.
