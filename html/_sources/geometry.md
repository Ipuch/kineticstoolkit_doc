# 3D rigid body geometry

The [](api/ktk.geometry.rst) module simplifies the calculation of linear algebric operations on series of points, vectors and transformation matrices.

In the following tutorials, we will do a quick starter on rigid body basics (points, vectors, frames, homogeneous transforms), how to navigate between frames and local/global coordinates, and how to extract rotation angles from a series of transformation matrices. Such understanding is required to understand the [](api/ktk.kinematics.rst) module which will be presented in the section after.
