# Default values

In {{pd_read_csv}}, the only mandatory argument is `filepath_or_buffer`, which is the name of the csv file ({numref}`fig_pandas_read_csv_signature`). Every other argument has a default value, and exists only to modify the default behaviour of the function.

Let's examine this concept with a simpler function. We define the following function that calculates the ground reaction force based on the acceleration and mass of a person's center of mass:

```{code-cell} ipython3
GRAVITATIONAL_CONSTANT = 9.81  # m/s2


def calculate_reaction_force(mass, acceleration):
    """
    Calculate the vertical reaction force based on the mass and acceleration.

    Parameters
    ----------
    mass : float
        Mass of the person in kg.
    acceleration : float
        Acceleration of the center of mass of the person, in m/s2.

    Returns
    -------
    float
        The ground reaction force, in N.

    """
    return (mass * acceleration) + (mass * GRAVITATIONAL_CONSTANT)


# Test the function
print(calculate_reaction_force(mass=60, acceleration=3.5))
```

:::{good-practice} Constants
Note these conventions used for GRAVITATIONAL_CONSTANT:

**No magic constants**: Instead of writing plainly 9.81 in the function's return statement, we defined the gravity using a name, and we used that name in the equation. We generally want to avoid "magical" constants dispersed around the code: we call them "magical" because after time, we tend to not remember what these values are for, other than making the function work "magically". Using named constants is a good way to auto-document the code.

**Top of the file**: It is common practice to define all the constants once and at a same obvious place, which is the top of the file.

**CAPITAL_CASE**: In Python, a constant is simply a variable that we agree to never modify. To emphasize that it should never be modified, it is common practice to user CAPITAL_CASE to define constants, whereas we use lower_case to define standard variables.
:::

Although this function works very well as is, we may want to generalize it for different gravitational constants, to simulate a similar task in a different gravity. In this case, the gravitational constant could become a parameter of the function:

```{code-cell} ipython3
def calculate_reaction_force(mass, acceleration, gravitational_constant):
    """
    Calculate the ground reaction force based on the mass and acceleration.

    Parameters
    ----------
    mass : float
        Mass of the person in kg.
    acceleration : float
        Acceleration of the center of mass of the person, in m/s2.
    gravitational_constant : float
        Gravitational constant, in m/s2.

    Returns
    -------
    float
        The ground reaction force, in N.

    """
    return (mass * acceleration) + (mass * gravitational_constant)


# Test the function:
print(
    calculate_reaction_force(
        mass=60, acceleration=3.5, gravitational_constant=9.81
    )
)

print(
    calculate_reaction_force(
        mass=60, acceleration=3.5, gravitational_constant=5.2
    )
)
```

However, since most of the time, the gravitational constant really is 9.81 m/sÂ², the function would be clearer with a default value for `gravitational_constant`. This is done by using an equal `=` sign in the signature:

```{code-cell} ipython3
def calculate_reaction_force(mass, acceleration, gravitational_constant=9.81):
    """
    Calculate the ground reaction force based on the mass and acceleration.

    Parameters
    ----------
    mass : float
        Mass of the person in kg.
    acceleration : float
        Acceleration of the center of mass of the person, in m/s2.
    gravitational_constant : float
        Gravitational constant, in m/s2. Default is 9.81.

    Returns
    -------
    float
        The ground reaction force, in N.

    """
    return (mass * acceleration) + (mass * gravitational_constant)
```

Now, on Earth at sea level, the function works exactly as the original one, without having to specify a gravitational constant:

```{code-cell} ipython3
print(calculate_reaction_force(mass=60, acceleration=3.5))
```

but it also adds the possibility to use other gravitational constants, using the same function:

```{code-cell} ipython3
print(
    calculate_reaction_force(
        mass=60, acceleration=3.5, gravitational_constant=5.2
    )
)
```
