# ðŸ“– Installing and importing

Kinetics Toolkit is distributed via [conda](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/kineticstoolkit) and [pip](https://pypi.org/project/kineticstoolkit). The source code is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/felixchenier/kineticstoolkit).

Since reading c3d files relies on [ezc3d](https://github.com/pyomeca/ezc3d) which binaries are distributed only via conda, the recommended installation method is to use conda. If needed, go to the [Miniconda website](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) to install a minimal conda installation.

## ðŸ“„ Installing and updating Kinetics Toolkit

In the Anaconda/Miniconda prompt or terminal:

```
conda install -c conda-forge kineticstoolkit
```

You can keep Kinetics Toolkit up to date by typing this command regularly:

```
conda update -c conda-forge kineticstoolkit
```



## ðŸ“„ Interactive Matplotlib graphics

Kinetics Toolkit's interactive functions make use of IPython's integration of matplotlib's event loop. When you want to use interactive functions in IPython such as panning and zooming plots, editing events, or visualizing 3d points, type:

```
%matplotlib qt5
```

before importing anything. Alternatively, we recommend installing the [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/) development environment because of its strong orientation towards science. Kinetics Toolkit is developed on Spyder. See [](python_configuring_spyder.md) to see different recommended settings in Spyder, such as removing the requirement to type `%matplotlib qt5`.

## ðŸ“„ Importing Kinetics Toolkit

There are two ways to import Kinetics Toolkit:

- In standard mode: `import kineticstoolkit as ktk`
- In lab mode: `import kineticstoolkit.lab as ktk`

:::{note}
The first import can take several seconds; subsequent imports are much faster.
:::

Lab mode is a convenience tool that sets some defaults for a more enjoyable data processing session in IPython-based environments such as Spyder. It automatically imports all installed [Kinetics Toolkit extensions](extensions.md), makes cosmetics changes to the representations (repr) of dictionaries, arrays and warnings, and improves Matplotlib defaults colours and sizes for interactive biomechanics work. See [](api/ktk.import_extensions.rst) and [](api/ktk.change_defaults.rst) for more information.

```
import kineticstoolkit.lab as ktk
```

is equivalent to:
```
import kineticstoolkit as ktk
ktk.import_extensions()
ktk.change_defaults()
```
