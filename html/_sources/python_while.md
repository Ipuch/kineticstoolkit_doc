# ðŸš§ Looping (while)

{{ stub }}

- The timing gates are broken. Someone enters manually the time of the chronometer each time the sprinter passes though a timing gate. Write a program that continuously asks the user to enter a new time, until the user presses 'Enter' without entering a time. Hint: in this case, the input() function will return an empty string: ''. Each time, the new time is added to a list of times.
