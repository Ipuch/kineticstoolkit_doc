Spyder is an integrated development environment (IDE) that was created for a scientific use. Its interface reminds Matlab. Spyder's standard look is shown below:

"Run file" button

Section A is the text editor. This is where you type and save scripts to be run later, either suddenly using the `Run file` button, or one cell at a time using the `Run cell` buttons (you create cells in a script by typing` # %% `, as shown in the screenshot).

Section B is a panel including, among others, these two interesting tools:

- A help tool where you can type the command or object on which you want help (similar to the `help` or` dir` functions mentioned later in the tutorial);
- A variable explorer where you can view the variables you have created.

Section C is the console where you can write python commands directly. This is the equivalent of the `>>>` console that we regularly see in tutorials.
