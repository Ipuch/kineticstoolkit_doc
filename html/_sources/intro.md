# Introduction

This is a free, continuously improving electronic book aimed to teach students and researchers how to perform biomechanical analyses using Python. It requires no prior experience in programming as it covers everything from installing a Python distribution to performing tridimensional analyses on time-varying data.

[](python_for_biomechanics.md) covers the basics of Python, Matplotlib and NumPy that are required to do general data processing. It includes numerous exercises that you can perform by yourself as you progress through the sections.

[](kineticstoolkit.md) presents topics related to biomechanics, such as time series analysis, filtering, 3d geometry, marker reconstruction techniques, etc. It also covers how to perform these operations using the open-source [kineticstoolkit package](https://github.com/felixchenier/kineticstoolkit).

This whole project is in constant progress, but it is stable enough to be used in most biomechanical analyses. See how you can [contribute](dev_contributing.md) to this project.
