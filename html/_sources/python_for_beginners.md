# ðŸš§ Learning Python for biomechanics

This is an open-source manual to learn to code using the Python ecosystem.

Python is a hugely popular programming language, and there are lots of courses, tutorials and examples available everywhere on the internet. The particularity of this manual is that it is specifically focused on biomechanical analysis.

As there are so many editors, packages, coding styles, etc. available, this manual makes a few opinionated choices for the readers, to guide them during their first steps into programming. We first learn how to install a working scientific Python environment, then we cover the most important elements of the Python language, NumPy, Matplotlib and some Pandas.

## Contents

This manual is written to be read from begin to start, and is filled with examples and exercices that are relevant to biomechanics. It contains examples that look like this:

```{code-cell}
# This is actual code that you may enter into the Python interpreter
# (e.g., Spyder's console)

print("And this is the result of the code")
```

It also contains exercises:

You are asked to program a one-line script that writes "Hello world!" to the console. When you are done, click the button below to see an example of such code.

```{code-cell}
:tags: [hide-cell]
print("Hello world!")
```

It also contains good practice, tips and notes.

This manual is a work in progress. All sections are still under development and those that are under heavy development or not even started are denoted with the ðŸš§ icon. Suggestions and discussions are highly appreciated. Please see [how you can contribute with ideas and points of view](dev_contributing.md).

Have a good read!
