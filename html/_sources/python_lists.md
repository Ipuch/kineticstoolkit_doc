# ðŸš§ Lists

{{ stub }}

- Creating a list
- Obtaining the length of a list
- Indexing a list
    - Extracting one element from a list
    - Extracting a list from a list
- Appending data to a list
- Mutability: contrarily to ints, floats and strings, modifying a list modifies it everywhere, including in a calling function.
- Tuple: an immutable list
- Integration exercise: We have a list where the 3 first data are maximal elevation angles for the shoulder, the 3 next are maximal internal rotation, and the 3 next are maximal external rotation. Therefore we have a list of 12 measurements. Write a line that returns:
    - a list of the 3 measurement of maximal elevation
    - a list of the 3 measurement of maximal internal rotation
    - the maximal elevation
    - the maximal external rotation
    - a list of length 3 that contains the maximal value of each assessment
- List comprehension will be viewed later.
