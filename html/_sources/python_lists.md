These sections present the list and its main methods.

**Context:** Suppose that we take three measurements of a given quantity (for instance, the height of a person). We could assign three variables for it (`height1`, `height2`, and `height3`) and write some code that processes it:

    # Calculate the mean height
    height = (height1 + height2 + height3) / 3

But what if we take hundreds of even thousands of measurements? At some point, it will be impossible to write clean code that process so many variables.

Python provides powerful constructs to contain large numbers of values in a structured way: the list, the tuple, the dictionary and the set, with the most useful and versatiles being the list and dictionary. Let's start with the list.

``` {tableofcontents}
```
