- Booleans and comparisons
- If, else, elif
- Logical operators
- Integration exercise: Program a function that calculate the speed between gates 1-2 and between gates 2-3, and that writes "You accelerated." if the speed was higher between gates 2-3 than between gates 1-2, and "You decelerated" otherwise. This function can use the function calculate_speed from last section. A sample call would be: print_acceleration_feedback(time_gate1=0.0, time_gate2=5.4, time_gate3=6.3, distance_gates12=50.0, distance_gates23=25.0). *Instead, write the prototype of the function.*
