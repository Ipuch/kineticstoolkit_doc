    "Lab mode\n",
    "========\n",
    "\n",
    "Kinetics Toolkit includes a lab mode that changes some defaults so that doing scientific work in IPython-based environments is more enjoyable (at least for me). This mode does not affect anything besides visual representations and is completely facultative.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "When to use lab mode\n",
    "--------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "__Use it__ if you want to use Kinetics Toolkit as an integrated work environment using IPython based environments (Spyder, Jupyter) in a biomechanics research labs. If you're not sure, use lab mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> import kineticstoolkit.lab as ktk\n",
    "\n",
    "__Do not use it__ if you already have a working environment and you simply want to use some ktk classes or functions within your own setup, and you don't want ktk to mess with your defaults. The appearance of the results may differ from the tutorials, which all use lab mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> import kineticstoolkit as ktk\n",

    "### Modification to repr of dictionaries ###\n",
    "\n",
    "Kinetics Toolkit often stores data as nested dictionaries, which can lead to very large printouts when we simply want to see the dictionary's contents. Importing ktk changes the repr of dictionaries in IPython so that a summary of the dict's content is shown, more like the representation of a Matlab struct.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's create a dummy dictionary:\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> import numpy as np\n",
    "    >>> data = dict()\n",
    "    >>> data['data1'] = np.arange(30)\n",
    "    >>> data['data2'] = np.arange(30) ** 2\n",
    "    >>> data['data3'] = np.arange(30) ** 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Default dict representation:\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> data\n",
    "    {'data1': array([ 0,  1,  2,  3,  4,  5,  6,  7,  8,  9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16,\n",

    "### Modification to warnings format ###\n",
    "\n",
    "Kinetics Toolkit sometimes generates warnings when calculations are encountering unexpected data, when assumptions were made or to flag relevant suspicious informations to the user. Importing ktk in lab mode pretty-prints those warnings so they are clearer to see and understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a default user warning would print as:\n",
    "\n",
    "    path/to/filename.py:1: UserWarning: Something strange happened in this function\n",
    "      warnings.warn('Something strange happened in this function')\n",
    "\n",
    "Importing ktk in lab mode reformats warnings as:\n",

    "\n",
    "### Modification to repr of numpy's floats ###\n",
    "\n",
    "Numpy is set to display floats with floating point precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Alternative defaults for matplotlib ###\n",
    "\n",
    "We assume that most work with figure is interactive, on screen. In that view,\n",
    "the following modifications are made to default matplotlib figures:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The standard dpi is changed to 75, which allows for more space to work by\n",
    "  reducing the font size on screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The standard figure size is changed to [10, 5], which is a little bigger\n",
    "  than the default and is thus more practical for interactive navigation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The default color order is changed to (rgbcmyko) with o being orange. The\n",
    "  first colors, red, green and blue, are consistent the colours assigned to\n",
    "  x, y and z in most 3D visualization softwares, and the next colours are\n",
    "  consistent with Matlab's legacy color order."
