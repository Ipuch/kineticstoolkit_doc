# ðŸ“– Looping using `for` and `range`

:::{card} Summary
This section shows how to repeat a code block using the `for` statement, either by looping through a variable directly, or by using a `range`.
:::

In the previous section, we learned how to use `while` to repeat a code block as long as a condition is true. Whereas the `while` statement is very powerful and sufficient for any looping, it is sometimes clearer to use the `for` statement instead.

The `for` statement means: "repeat this code block for each element of this variable". This means that we can easily iterate through each element of a list:

```
for variable_name in the_list:
    instruction1
    instruction2
    instruction3
    etc.
```

For example:

```{code-cell}
for item in [0, 1, 2, 'three', 'four']:
    print("The current item is:", item)
```


## ðŸ’ª Exercise 1

We have some measurements in metres:

```{code-cell}
meters = [0.329, 0.009, 0.210, 0.726, 0.686, 0.912, 0.285, 0.833, 0.334, 0.165]
```

In the previous section, we created a list named `millimeters` by multiplying every element of `meters` by 1000, using a `while` loop:

```{code-cell}
# Create an empty list of the same measurements in millimeters, that we will
# fill up using a while loop.
millimeters = []

# Multiply each element of meters by 1000, and append it to the millimeters list.
i = 0
while i < len(meters):
    millimeters.append(meters[i] * 1000)
    i += 1

# Done.
millimeters
```

This time, create a similar code using a `for` loop instead of a `while` loop.

```{code-cell}
:tags: [hide-cell]

# Create an empty list of the same measurements in millimeters, that we will
# fill up using a for loop.
millimeters = []

# Multiply each element of meters by 1000, and append it to the millimeters list.
for one_measurement in meters:
    millimeters.append(one_measurement * 1000)

# Done.
millimeters
```

:::{good-practice} `for` vs `while`
Note how the solution of this exercise is much clearer using `for` than `while`: we don't need to initialize an index at 0 before starting the loop, and we don't need to manually increment the index at the end of each loop. Therefore, in this case, using a `for` loop is less error-prone than using a `while` loop.

Generally:
- We use a `for` loop when we know the number of iterations in advance (in the case above, this is the length of the list);
- We use a `while` loop when we don't know in advance when the loop will stop (e.g., if the stop condition is the result of a calculation).

## ðŸ“„ Range

A range is a type of variable that specifies a series of values using a final value, an optional initial value, and an optional increment. Since a range makes an ideal counter, it is often used with `for` loops to repeat a code block a given number of time:

```{code-cell}
for i in range(5):  # Repeat the following code block 5 times
    print("The variable i is:", i)
```

In this example, the `range` function creates a sequence of values from 0 (inclusive) to 5 (exclusive), and `i` takes each of these values sequentially. It is possible to create more complex ranges, by using one of the three forms of the `range` function:

- `range(end)`
- `range(begin, end)`
- `range(begin, end, step)`

Creating ranges is very similar to usual [slicing](python_lists_slicing.md), with `begin` being inclusive and `end` being exclusive. Some examples:

```{code-cell}
# Count from 5 to 9
for i in range(5, 10):
    print("The variable i is:", i)
```

```{code-cell}
# Count from 0 to 8 by steps of 2
for i in range(0, 10, 2):
    print("The variable i is:", i)
```

```{code-cell}
# Count from 5 to 9 by steps of 2
for i in range(5, 10, 2):
    print("The variable i is:", i)
```


## ðŸ’ª Exercise 2

A therapist measures a patient's maximal shoulder flexion angle three times. Write a program that creates a list of these three measurements based on user input, following this example:

:::{admonition} Example of program output
```none
Enter max shoulder flexion (deg) [measurement 1]: <User enters 119>
Enter max shoulder flexion (deg) [measurement 2]: <User enters 124>
Enter max shoulder flexion (deg) [measurement 3]: <User enters 123>
Max shoulder flexion: [119.0, 124.0, 123.0]
```
:::

:::{toggle}
```
# Initialize an empty list of measurements
measurements = []

# Ask the values
for i in range(3):
    str_value = input(
        f"Enter max shoulder flexion (deg) [measurement {i}]: "
    )
    measurements.append(float(str_value))

# Print the result
print("Max shoulder flexion:", measurements)
```
:::


## ðŸ’ª Exercise 3

Let's redo the following exercise, this time with a `for` instead of a `while`.

Using an instrumented walkway, we recorded the following positions of heel strike, first for the right heel, second for the left heel, third for the right heel, etc.:

```{code-cell}
# y-coordinates of each heel strike, in meters
y = [0.13, 0.72, 1.29, 1.93, 2.55, 3.12, 3.71, 4.34, 4.95, 5.56]
```

*Figure 1. Foot coordinates obtained via an instrumented walkway*

Write a program that creates a list named `step_lengths`, that contains the length of every step. The first step length would be `y[1] - y[0]`, the second would be `y[2] - y[1]`, etc. In this specific example, we recorded nine steps, but your code must work on any number of steps.

```{code-cell}
:tags: [hide-cell]

# y-coordinates of each heel strike, in meters
y = [0.13, 0.72, 1.29, 1.93, 2.55, 3.12, 3.71, 4.34, 4.95, 5.56]

# Initialize an empty list to put the results of our calculations
step_lengths = []

# Count the number of steps in this set of data
n_steps = len(y) - 1

# Calculate the step lengths
for i in range(n_steps):
    step_lengths.append(y[i + 1] - y[i])

# Done!
step_lengths
```
