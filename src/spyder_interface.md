In the figure above, Section A is the [console](spyder_console.md), and is the same as the `>>>` console that we regularly see in tutorials. Any command that you enter there is executed immediately, and the output is returned just below.

Section B is the [script editor](spyder_script.md). This is where you will be writing most of your code.

Section C is a collection of panes that can be helpful during data processing, for example to [getting help on a function](spyder_help.md).
