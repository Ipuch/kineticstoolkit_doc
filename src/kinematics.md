# Kinematics analysis

:::{card} Summary
- The [](api/ktk.Player.rst) class is an interactive 3D-viewer specifically designed for visualization of markers.
- The [](api/ktk.kinematics.rst) module is a module that allows creating point clusters, reconstructing occluded or missing markers, and then processing those trajectories using the lower-level [](api/ktk.geometry.rst) module (e.g., generating local coordinate systems, calculating joint angles).

In the following tutorials, we will use the [](api/ktk.Player.rst) class and the [](api/ktk.kinematics.rst) module to visualize and process real-life acquisitions of 3d markers, to calculate a series of joint angles, and to reconstruct virtual markers using different methods such as calibration markers or probing.
