# Python basics

To discover the basics of Python, we will refer in this chapter to two series of tutorials that we believe are of exceptional quality:

1) [Socratica's](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW6TXMZ5Pq6yL6_k5NZ2e0Q) tutorials with Ulka Simone Mohanty. Be sure to watch their [introductory video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY6m6_IIN94&list=PLi01XoE8jYohWFPpC17Z-wWhPOSuh8Er-&index=2)!
2) [Corey Schafer's](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCezIgC97PvUuR4_gbFUs5g) tutorials, which go a little deeper than Socratica's.

But let first install Python and an integrated development environment, in the next section.
