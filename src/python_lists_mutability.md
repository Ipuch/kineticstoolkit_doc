Integration exercise: We have a list where the 3 first data are maximal elevation angles for the shoulder, the 3 next are maximal internal rotation, and the 3 next are maximal external rotation. Therefore we have a list of 12 measurements. Write a line that returns:
    - a list of the 3 measurement of maximal elevation
    - a list of the 3 measurement of maximal internal rotation
    - the maximal elevation
    - the maximal external rotation
    - a list of length 3 that contains the maximal value of each assessment
