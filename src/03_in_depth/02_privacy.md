# Privacy statement

Kinetics Toolkit periodically checks if a serious bug has been identified in the version you are using (e.g., if a function leads to wrong results that could invalidate your scientific conclusions). For this matter, the library regularly connects to this website using a simple call to https://kineticstoolkit.uqam.ca/api/import_check.php?version=YOUR_VERSION. The respect of your privacy and the limitation of data transfer is of utmost importance, and therefore:

- No information other than your IP address and operating system is transmitted to our server;
- The amount of transferred data is very light (a few bytes) and cached;
- Nothing happens in case of connection failure, thus there is no need to be connected to the internet at all.
