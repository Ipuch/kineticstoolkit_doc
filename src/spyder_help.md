# Getting help

:::

In the screenshot above, section C is a collection of panes that can be helpful during data processing. The help pane is particularly helpful to navigate the documentation of a given module or package. For example, to better understand how to use the Python `max` function, you could write `max` in the help pane.

Note that you can also get help from the console, using the `help` function:

```{code-cell} ipython3
help(max)
```
