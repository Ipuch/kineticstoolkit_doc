# Looping (for)

{{ stub }}

- If the number of times is known in advance, the for statement is simpler than the while statement.
- Repeating an action a given number of times using a range
- Going over a list
- Using list indexing: going over a given range of a list
- Using enumerate to get both the list element and its position in the list
- Integration exercise: Program a function that goes over a list of timing gate "global" times (timing gates are all 50m apart from each other) and that creates a list of velocities.
