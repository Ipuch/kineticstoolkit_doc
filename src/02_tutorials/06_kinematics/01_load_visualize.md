# Reading and visualizing marker trajectories

In this tutorial, we will visualize the kinematics of an athlete who propelled a racing wheelchair on a training roller during 10 seconds. In this acquisition, the marker trajectories were saved as a `c3d` file.

```{code-cell}
import kineticstoolkit.lab as ktk
```

## Reading marker trajectories

The [kinematics](/api/kineticstoolkit.kinematics.rst) module provide the functions [kinematics.read_c3d_file()](/api/kineticstoolkit.kinematics.read_c3d_file.rst) and [kinematics.read_n3d_file()](/api/kineticstoolkit.kinematics.read_n3d_file.rst) to read files generated by common motion capture devices. Reading c3d files is provided by the external [ezc3d](https://github.com/pyomeca/ezc3d) package; see the "Installing" section for information on how to install it.

Let's read the c3d file we recorded in this acquisition:

```{code-cell}
markers = ktk.kinematics.read_c3d_file(
    ktk.config.root_folder + '/data/kinematics/racing_full.c3d')

markers
```

We see that this acquisition has 46 markers. Each data key corresponds to the trajectory of one marker:

```{code-cell}
markers.data
```

## Visualizing the markers

Now we'll take a look at this acquisition using [ktk.Player](/api/kineticstoolkit.Player.rst), a matplotlib-based interactive user interface aimed at visualizing markers, rigid bodies and segments in three dimensions.

For the `Player` class to be interactive, you must select an interactive backend for IPython. See the "Installing" section for more information. It is also possible to set a point of view and generate a fixed animation in inline matplotlib environments such as Jupyter notebooks. This is what we will do in these tutorials.

Set a point of view:

```{code-cell}
viewing_options = {
    'zoom': 3.5,
    'azimuth': 0.8,
    'elevation': 0.16,
    'translation': (0.2, -0.7)
}
```

Visualize the markers (note that the second line is only required in inline matplotlib environments such as Jupyter notebooks):

```{code-cell}
player = ktk.Player(markers, **viewing_options)

player.to_html5(start_time=0, stop_time=1)  # Show only one second of acquisition
```

Note the colored global reference frame on the bottom. This reference frame and every other (as we will create in the next tutorial) follow the same standard color scheme:

- x = Red
- y = Green
- z = Blue

## Drawing links between markers

To ease the visualization, it is often practical to create segments by linking markers with lines. Here, we will create links between the right arm markers and between the right forearm markers.

```{code-cell}
segments = dict()  # Will contain all segment definitions

# Create a segment definition for the right arm
segments['ArmR'] = {
    
    # Segment color in [red, green, blue] (each between 0 et 1)
    'Color': [1, 0.25, 0],
    
    # List of links, defined by marker names
    'Links': [['AcromionR', 'MedialEpicondyleR'],
              ['AcromionR', 'LateralEpicondyleR'],
              ['AcromionR', 'OlecraneR']]
}

# Create a segment definition for the right forearm
segments['ForearmR'] = {
    'Color': [1, 0.5, 0],
    'Links': [['MedialEpicondyleR', 'RadialStyloidR'],
              ['MedialEpicondyleR', 'UlnarStyloidR'],
              ['LateralEpicondyleR', 'RadialStyloidR'],
              ['LateralEpicondyleR', 'UlnarStyloidR'],
              ['OlecraneR', 'RadialStyloidR'],
              ['OlecraneR', 'UlnarStyloidR'],
              ['UlnarStyloidR', 'RadialStyloidR']]
}
```

Now we can load a Player again with the segments we just defined:

```{code-cell} ipython3
player = ktk.Player(markers, segments=segments, **viewing_options)

player.to_html5(start_time=0, stop_time=1)  # Show only one second of acquisition
```
