# Kinematics analysis

The [kinematics](../../api/kineticstoolkit.kinematics.rst) module is a higher level module that is specific to kinematic analysis. Along with the [Player](../../api/kineticstoolkit.Player.rst) class, it allows opening and viewing trajectories of markers from 3D acquisition files, creating point clusters, reconstructing occluded or missing markers, and then process those trajectories using the lower-level [geometry](../../api/kineticstoolkit.geometry.rst) module (e.g., generating local coordinate systems, calculating joint angles).
