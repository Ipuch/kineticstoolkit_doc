# Rigid body geometry

The [geometry](/api/kineticstoolkit.geometry.rst) module simplifies the calculation of linear algebric operations on series of points, vectors and transformation matrices.

In this tutorial, we will do a quick starter on rigid body basics (points, vectors, frames, homogeneous transforms), how to navigate between frames and local/global coordinates, and how to extract rotation angles from a series of transformation matrices.
