# ðŸ’ª Exercise

We want to create a variable named `mass` that will contain the mass of a person in kg. This person has a mass of 68 kg. Since this is a physical value, this should be a float, hence the decimal point:

```
mass = 68.0
```

How would you create the following variables?

- `hip_height`: The height of the hip in standing position, which is 1 m.
- `i_trial`: The trial number where someone reached the highest isometric contraction, which is 3.
- `n_trials`: The total number of trials someone tried to reach the highest isometric contraction, which is 4.
- `emg_max`: The EMG value measured during a maximal isometric contraction, which is 34 Î¼V.

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [hide-cell]

hip_height = 1.0
i_trial = 3
n_trials = 4
emg_max = 34.0
```
