# ðŸ’ª Exercise 1

Here is a list:

```{code-cell} ipython3
list_of_strings = ["zero", "one", "two", "three", "four", "five"]
```

What would be the code to get a list identical to `list_of_strings`, but with every element reversed (the first becomes the last, the last becomes the first)?

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [hide-cell]

# We start at the last element of list_of_strings.
# We can use negative indexing to get this element: -1
# Therefore, the first number of the slice (start index) is -1.

# We will go backward through the list.
# Therefore, the third number of the slice (increment) is -1.

# We go through all the list. There is no ending point.
# Therefore, there is no second number in the slice.

list_of_strings[-1::-1]
```
