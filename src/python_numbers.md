# Numbers

:::{card} Summary
This section explains the difference between classes of numbers (integers, floats and complex numbers), and shows the exponentiation (`**`) arithmetic operation.
:::

Up to now, we referred to numbers simply as "numbers". In reality, numbers belong to different sets. Python provides three sets of numbers:

- Integer numbers: `int`
- Real numbers: `float`
- Complex numbers: `complex`

For now, we will focus only on integers and floats.
