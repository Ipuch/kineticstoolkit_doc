# Dictionaries

The last, very important built-in python type is the dictionary (`dict`). Like lists and tuples, a dictionary contains any number of elements. However, lists and tuples store elements in a sequential way that we address using indexes or slices, whereas dictionaries store elements non-sequentially using keys. This section introduces how to create, read and modify dictionaries.

:::{tip}
If you come from Matlab, Python's `dict` can be seen as a replacement for Matlab's `struct`.
