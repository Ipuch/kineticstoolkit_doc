Section B is the script editor. It is simply a text editor that allows saving  code as a .py text file, to execute it all together later.

You can execute a script by clicking on the `Run File` button (green triangle in the following toolbar, which can have different looks according to your configuration):

As an exercise, create a file named `hello_world.py` that prints "Hello World", and run it using the `Run File` button. You should see the text "Hello World" appear in the console.
