# Working with cycles

This section introduces the [](api/ktk.cycles.rst) module and its functions:

- [ktk.cycles.detect_cycles](api/ktk.cycles.detect_cycles.rst)
- [ktk.cycles.time_normalize](api/ktk.cycles.time_normalize.rst)
- [ktk.cycles.stack](api/ktk.cycles.stack.rst)
- [ktk.cycles.unstack](api/ktk.cycles.unstack.rst)
- [ktk.cycles.most_repeatable_cycles](api/ktk.cycles.most_repeatable_cycles.rst)


For this section, we will use [a dataset of wheelchair propulsion kinetics](dataset_kinetics_wheelchair_propulsion.md).

```{code-cell} ipython3
import kineticstoolkit.lab as ktk
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

filename = ktk.doc.download("kinetics_wheelchair_propulsion.ktk.zip")
ts = ktk.load(filename)

ts.plot("Forces")
```

## Detecting cycles

The [ktk.cycles.detect_cycles](api/ktk.cycles.detect_cycles.rst) function detects biphasic cycles in a TimeSeries, and adds transitions as events. Each cycle has three events:

- The start of the first phase, named using the `event_names` parameters;
- The start of the second phase, also named using the `event_names` parameters;
- The end of the cycle, always named `_`.

The function does not modify the TimeSeries data, only the events. It uses two thresholds applied to an unidimensional signal from this TimeSeries. In this example, this signal will be the total force $F_{tot}$. This could also apply to gait, or one could also use only the vertical ground reaction force, depending on the lab's convention or methods.

Let's calculate $F_{tot}$ based on the three force components, and add it as a new data of the TimeSeries as it will be our source for detecting the cycles.

```{code-cell} ipython3
ts.data["Ftot"] = np.sqrt(np.sum(ts.data["Forces"] ** 2, axis=1))
ts.plot(["Forces", "Ftot"])
```

We then define some threshold values for $F_\text{tot}$:
- Push starts when $F_\text{tot}$ raises to more than 10 N;
- Recovery starts when $F_\text{tot}$ decreases to less than 5 N.

```{code-cell} ipython3
ts_with_events = ktk.cycles.detect_cycles(
    ts, "Ftot", event_names=["push", "recovery"], thresholds=[10, 5]
)
ts_with_events.plot(["Forces", "Ftot"])
```

We observe that most cycles are well identified, but more cycles have been identified. We can reject "false" cycles based on a minimal duration:

```{code-cell} ipython3
ts_with_events = ktk.cycles.detect_cycles(
    ts,
    "Ftot",
    event_names=["push", "recovery"],
    thresholds=[10, 5],
    min_durations=[0.2, 0.2],
)
ts_with_events.plot(["Forces", "Ftot"])
```

There are other arguments available to filter out more cycles, such as max durations, and minimal/maximal peak height. These arguments are documented in the [ktk.cycles.detect_cycles](api/ktk.cycles.detect_cycles.rst) function. Here, we may reject pushes that do not reach a minimal peak height of 45Â N.

:::{good-practice} Manual editing
Although detecting cycles automatically seems time-saving, it is always an excellent idea to manually inspect any signal that is being processed based on such "arbitrary" constraints. Use the interactive [ktk.TimeSeries.ui_edit_events](api/ktk.TimeSeries.ui_edit_events.rst) method to inspect, correct and manually identify cycles.
:::

```{code-cell} ipython3
ts_with_events = ktk.cycles.detect_cycles(
    ts,
    "Ftot",
    event_names=["push", "recovery"],
    thresholds=[10, 5],
    min_durations=[0.2, 0.2],
    min_peak_heights=[45, -np.Inf],
)
ts_with_events.plot(["Forces", "Ftot"])
plt.tight_layout()
```

:::{tip}
We observe an `_` event at the end. There are in fact such `_` events at the end of each cycle (look how each next push's 'p' letter seems underlined). As explained above, the `detect_cycles` function adds an `_` event at the end of each cycle. These events are usefull to extract cycles of phases using TimeSeries methods such as [ktk.TimeSeries.get_ts_between_events](api/ktk.TimeSeries.get_ts_between_events.rst).

## Time-normalizing cycles

Once the cycles have been detected, we can time-normalize them using [ktk.cycles.time_normalize](api/ktk.cycles.time_normalize.rst) to get them on the same time scale (a percentage of the cycle).

Here, every complete cycle will be time-normalized from 0 to 100%, with a new cycle starting at every multiple of 100%:

```{code-cell} ipython3
ts_normalized_on_cycle = ktk.cycles.time_normalize(
    ts_with_events, event_name1="push", event_name2="_"
)

ts_normalized_on_cycle.plot(["Forces", "Ftot"])
```

To time-normalize only during the push phase, we would define `event_name2` as "recovery" instead of " _ ":

```{code-cell} ipython3
ts_normalized_on_push = ktk.cycles.time_normalize(
    ts_with_events, "push", "recovery"
)

ts_normalized_on_push.plot(["Forces", "Ftot"])
```

It is also possible to include data before 0% and after 100% using the `span` parameter. For example, to include pre-push (-25% to 0%) and post-recovery (100% to 125%):

```{code-cell} ipython3
ts_normalized_on_push_with_span = ktk.cycles.time_normalize(
    ts_with_events, "push", "recovery", span=[-20, 125]
)

ts_normalized_on_push_with_span.plot(["Forces", "Ftot"])
```

In this case, each time point still represents 1% of a cycle, but the TimeSeries wrap every 145 points (0 to 19 is the pre-push for the first cycle, 20 to 119 is the first push, 120 to 144 is the post-release for the first cycle, etc.).

## Combining the cycles

Cycles are often analyzed together. The [ktk.cycles.stack](api/ktk.cycles.stack.rst) generates a dictionary of numpy arrays with the first dimension being the cycle and the second being the percentage of cycle.

```{code-cell} ipython3
data = ktk.cycles.stack(ts_normalized_on_push)

data
```

It is now easier to perform operations on ensembles of cycles. For example, to plot $F_\text{tot}$ in each cycle one of top of the other:

```{code-cell} ipython3
n_cycles = data["Ftot"].shape[0]
for i_cycle in range(n_cycles):
    plt.plot(data["Ftot"][i_cycle], label=f"Cycle {i_cycle}")

plt.legend();
```

The inverse operation of [ktk.cycles.stack](api/ktk.cycles.stack.rst) is [ktk.cycles.unstack](api/ktk.cycles.unstack.rst).

## Finding the most repeatable cycles

We can sort the cycles in order of reproducibility (get which cycles are the most repeatable, and which cycles are unique)[ktk.cycles.most_repeatable_cycles](api/ktk.cycles.most_repeatable_cycles.rst). Here, we will base this analysis on the `Ftot` signal.

```{code-cell} ipython3
index = ktk.cycles.most_repeatable_cycles(data["Ftot"])

index
```

We see that cycles 1 and 2 were identified to be the most representative of all cycles, while cycles 3 and 4 are the most different. However, please keep in mind that this operation is not optimal for so few cycles (five total).
