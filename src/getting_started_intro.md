# Introduction

This book is a free and continuously improving tool to learn how to perform biomechanical analyses using Python. It requires no prior experience in programming as it covers everything from installing a Python distribution to performing tridimensional analyses on time-varying data.

Part I presents how to create a working environment and navigate into the Spyder interface to write and execute your first program.

Part II covers the basics of Python, Matplotlib and NumPy to perform general data processing. It includes numerous exercises that you can do by yourself as you progress through the sections.

Part III presents topics related to biomechanics, such as time series analysis, filtering, 3D geometry, marker reconstruction techniques, etc., and how to perform these operations using the open-source `kineticstoolkit` package:
