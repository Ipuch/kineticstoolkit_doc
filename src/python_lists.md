# Lists

:::{card} Summary
These sections present the list and its main methods.

**Context:** Suppose that we take three measurements of a given quantity (for instance, the height of a person). It would make sense to assign three variables for it: `height1`, `height2`, and `height3`, and then write some code that processes it:

```
# Calculate the mean height
height = (height1 + height2 + height3) / 3
```

But what if we take hundreds of even thousands of measurements? At some point, we could not afford one variable per measurement.

Python provides powerful constructs such as the list, the tuple, the dictionary and the set. These "containers" allow holding a large number of values in a structured way. Let's start with the list.

```{tableofcontents}
```
