    - Extracting one element from a list
    - Extracting a list from a list

- Mutability: contrarily to ints, floats and strings, modifying a list modifies it everywhere, including in a calling function.
- Tuple: an immutable list
- Integration exercise: There are 4 timing gates on a track, and the athletes went through the whole track 3 times. Therefore we have a list of 12 times. Write a line that returns:
    - the first time of the list
    - the last time of the list
    - a list of two elements that contain the first and last times
    - a list of four elements that corresponds to the four laps of the first timing gate.
    - a list of four elements that corresponds to the four laps of the second timing gate.
- List comprehension will be viewed later.
