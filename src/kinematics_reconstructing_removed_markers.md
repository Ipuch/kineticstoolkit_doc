# ðŸ“– Reconstructing removed markers

:::{card} Summary
This tutorial explains how to use the [ktk.kinematics](api/ktk.kinematics.rst) module to reconstruct markers that were present during a calibration acquisition, but that were then removed.
:::

Rigid bodies affixed to segments are generally used to reconstruct points where it is difficult or impossible to affix a real marker. For example, if a marker would be at risk of falling during the action, it can be installed during a short calibration acquisition, and then removed during the action.

The following example represents such a situation:
- With a rigid body of three markers affixed to the left arm, and a single marker affixed to the left lateral elbow epicondyle, an acquisition of a few seconds was recorded with the participant barely moving.
- After removing the elbow epicondyle marker, a wheelchair propulsion acquisition was recorded.
- We want to reconstruct the trajectory of the left lateral elbow epicondyle during the propulsion acquisition, even if it was not present during this acquisition.

## ðŸ“„ Loading sample data

We will create two TimeSeries, one representing the markers available during the static acquisition, and the other representing the markers available during the propulsion acquisition.

```{code-cell} ipython3
import kineticstoolkit.lab as ktk
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# Static acquisition
markers_static = ktk.read_c3d(
    ktk.doc.download("kinematics_racing_static.c3d")
)["Points"]
markers_static = markers_static.get_subset(
    ["ArmL1", "ArmL2", "ArmL3", "LateralEpicondyleL"]
)
plt.subplot(2, 2, 1)
markers_static.plot("ArmL1")
plt.subplot(2, 2, 2)
markers_static.plot("ArmL2")
plt.subplot(2, 2, 3)
markers_static.plot("ArmL3")
plt.subplot(2, 2, 4)
markers_static.plot("LateralEpicondyleL")
plt.suptitle("Static acquisition")
plt.tight_layout()

# Propulsion acquisition
markers_propulsion = ktk.read_c3d(
    ktk.doc.download("kinematics_racing_propulsion.c3d")
)["Points"]
markers_propulsion = markers_propulsion.get_subset(
    [
        "ArmL1",
        "ArmL2",
        "ArmL3",
    ]
)
plt.figure()
plt.subplot(2, 2, 1)
markers_propulsion.plot("ArmL1")
plt.subplot(2, 2, 2)
markers_propulsion.plot("ArmL2")
plt.subplot(2, 2, 3)
markers_propulsion.plot("ArmL3")
plt.suptitle("Propulsion acquisition")
plt.tight_layout()
```

## ðŸ“„ Creating a cluster of markers

The idea is very similar to the previous tutorial, where we reconstructed missing markers that belonged to the same rigid body. In this new example, since the lateral elbow epicondyle belongs to the same segment as the rigid body, then we can also include it in the marker cluster.

```{code-cell} ipython3
cluster = ktk.kinematics.create_cluster(
    markers_static,
    ["ArmL1", "ArmL2", "ArmL3", "LateralEpicondyleL"],
)

# Print the cluster contents
print(cluster["ArmL1"])
print(cluster["ArmL2"])
print(cluster["ArmL3"])
print(cluster["LateralEpicondyleL"])
```

## ðŸ“„ Tracking the cluster

Now, we can track this cluster to reconstruct the whole set of four markers, including the epicondyle, during the propulsion acquisitions.

```{code-cell} ipython3
reconstructed_markers_propulsion = ktk.kinematics.track_cluster(
    markers_propulsion,
    cluster,
)

# Plot the results
plt.subplot(2, 2, 1)
reconstructed_markers_propulsion.plot("ArmL1")
plt.subplot(2, 2, 2)
reconstructed_markers_propulsion.plot("ArmL2")
plt.subplot(2, 2, 3)
reconstructed_markers_propulsion.plot("ArmL3")
plt.subplot(2, 2, 4)
reconstructed_markers_propulsion.plot("LateralEpicondyleL")
plt.tight_layout()
```
