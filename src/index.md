[Kinetics Toolkit (ktk)](https://kineticstoolkit.uqam.ca) is:

1. A set of online resources for students and researchers for learning 3D biomechanical data processing using Python;
2. An open-source Python package that does (only) the heavy-lifting of such processing, so that the users can (and must) concentrate on what data processing they want to perform.

This is a work in progress, but the underlying Python package is well advanced and is already used for research. Please see how you can [contribute](dev_contributing.md) to this project.
