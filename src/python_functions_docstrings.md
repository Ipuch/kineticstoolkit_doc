# ðŸ“– Docstrings

:::{card} Summary
This section shows how to properly document a function so that future users (or future-yourself) will understand the meaning of the code even months after.
:::

We theoretically know enough on functions to follow on with other concepts. However, although the solutions to the previous exercises do work, they could be much more documented. Keep in mind that code is wrote once, often by only one programmer, but it is read many times after, often by other people. An undocumented function is usually clear to the programmer while it is being written; but will it be months later? Docstrings are the most important way to document functions.

## ðŸ“„ What is a docstring

A docstring is literally a **string** that **doc**uments a function. While being facultative, it is almost mandatory in any code other than very simple scripts. A standard docstrings is a triple-quote string placed just below the function signature. Here is what a good docstring for last section's `format_info` function would be:

```{code-cell} ipython3
def format_info(i_participant, first_name, last_name, age, height, weight):
    """
    Format the provided information into a human-readable string.

    Parameters
    ----------
    i_participant : int
        Identifier for the participant
    first_name : str
        First name (given name) of the participant
    last_name : str
        Last name (surname) of the participant
    age : float
        Age of the participant, in years
    height : float
        Height of the participant, in meters
    weight : float
        Weight of the participant, in kg

    Returns
    -------
    str
        A human-readable string based on the provided information.

    """
    output = (
        "=============\n"
        f"Participant {i_participant}: {first_name} {last_name}\n"
        f"{age} years old\n"
        f"Height: {height} m\n"
        f"Weight: {weight} kg\n"
        f"BMI: {weight / (height ** 2):.2f}\n"
        "============="
    )
    return output
```

:::{note}
The style used for this docstring is [numpydoc](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html). There is no requirement to follow this specific style over another one, but since it is used by most major Python packages in numerical analysis (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, SciPy), then we chose to also follow this style.
:::

Minimally, a docstring clearly indicates:
1. What the function does, on one single line.
2. What are the types and contents of every expected parameter.
3. What are the type and contents of the return value, if any.

As you notice in the example above, we have more lines of documentation than lines of code. This is not unusual, and this is not a bad practice at all. After all, a well-documented, simple code is much better than an undocumented, complex code!

## ðŸ“„ Consulting docstrings

Since they are so ubiquitous, docstrings can be read without having to open the function's source code. Try executing the last function definition, then:

1. Type `format_info` in Spyder's help browser. The docstring appears, all well-formatted:

![Spyder help -width:wider](_static/images/python_function_spyder_help.png)

2. Or type `help(format_info)` in the console:

```{code-cell} ipython3
help(format_info)
```


## ðŸ“„ Type annotations

In addition to docstrings, type annotations are increasingly popular to document the types of a function's parameters and return value. Like docstrings, type annotations are facultative, but are generally helpful to clearly design and document functions.

The syntax for type annotations is `:` for the parameters, and `->` for return values (see the `->` as a right-arrow). In the `format_info` function above, we documented the parameters and return types in the docstring. Using type annotations, we could instead document those directly in the signature:

```{code-cell} ipython3
def format_info(
    i_participant: int,
    first_name: str,
    last_name: str,
    age: float,
    height: float,
    weight: float
) -> str:
    """
    Format the provided information into a human-readable string.

    Parameters
    ----------
    i_participant
        Identifier for the participant
    first_name
        First name (given name) of the participant
    last_name
        Last name (surname) of the participant
    age
        Age of the participant, in years
    height
        Height of the participant, in meters
    weight
        Weight of the participant, in kg

    Returns
    -------
    str
        A human-readable string based on the provided information.

    """
```

:::{note}
Writing a good docstring is way more important than using type annotations. The choice of using type annotations or not is strictly up to you, but it is important to know that it exists, if only to understand others' code.
