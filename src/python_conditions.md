# Conditions and booleans

:::{card} Summary
This section shows how to perform comparisons and boolean (logical) operations and how to use these operations to program conditional code (`if`, `else`, `elif`).
:::

In the last sections, we learned how to create functions to execute groups of arithmetic operations, to store variables and to print results. These examples were straightforward, in the sense that they only executed a predefined sequence of operations. This section shows how to build programs that are able to execute different instructions as a consequence of comparisons and conditions.
