# Conditions and booleans

:::{card} Summary
This section shows how to perform comparisons and boolean (logical) operations and how to use these operations to program conditional code (`if`, `else`, `elif`).
:::

In the last sections, we learned how to create functions to execute groups of arithmetic operations, to store variables and to print results. These examples were straightforward, in the sense that they only executed a predefined sequence of operations. This section shows how to build programs that are able to execute different instructions as a consequence of comparisons and conditions.

## ðŸ“„ Boolean and comparisons

Comparisons are performed using the following operators:

| Operator | Meaning          |
| --------:|:---------------- |
|     `==` | Equal            |
|     `!=` | Unequal          |
|      `>` | Strictly greater |
|     `>=` | Greater or equal |
|      `<` | Strictly lower   |
|     `<=` | Lower or equal   |

For example, the following comparison gives `True`:

```{code-cell}
10 > 5
```

while this one gives `False`:

```{code-cell}
10 == 5
```

The result of a comparison is always a boolean variable. We already know the following types of variable: `string`, `int`, `float` and `complex`. Boolean variables, `bool`, are the simplest: they can be only either `True` or `False`.

Obviously, comparing a constant with another constant has little sense. However, comparing variables with constants, or variables with other variables, is very common and helpful:

```{code-cell}
WORLD_RECORD = 240
my_score = 236

# Verify if I broke the world record
my_score > WORLD_RECORD
```

:::{important}
You may note that the equality comparison is a double-equal `==` instead of a single one `=`. This is to avoid confusion between a comparison:

```
a == 5
```
which returns `True` or `False`

and an assignment:

```
a = 5
```
which assigns the value of 5 to variable `a`.
:::

## ðŸ“„ Conditional code: `if`, `elif`, `else`

Now that we understand how to make comparisons, let's see how to control the flow of the program as a result of these comparisons. The most important keyword for this matter is `if`:

```
if condition:
    perform_task2()
    perform_task1()
    perform_task2()
```

The `if` checks if a condition is met. The code block that follows the `if` statement is executed only if the condition evaluates to `True`.

```{code-cell}
WORLD_RECORD = 240
my_score = 236

# Verify if I broke the world record
if my_score > WORLD_RECORD:
    print("I broke the world record!")

```

This code did nothing, because the condition evaluated to `False`.

Using the `else` keyword, it is possible to executes one action if the condition if `True` and another action if the condition is `False`:

```{code-cell}
WORLD_RECORD = 240
my_score = 236

# Verify if I broke the world record
if my_score > WORLD_RECORD:
    print("I broke the world record!")

else:
    print("Nothing to see here.")

```

It is also possible to evaluate different conditions in a same `if` series, using `elif`, which stands for "else if":

```{code-cell}
WORLD_RECORD = 240
my_score = 236

# Verify if I broke the world record
if my_score > WORLD_RECORD:
    print("I broke the world record!")

elif my_score == WORLD_RECORD:
    print("I matched the world record!")

else:
    print("Nothing to see here.")

```

There may be more than one `elif` in a same series of comparisons:

```{code-cell}
WORLD_RECORD = 240
my_score = 236

# Verify if I broke the world record
if my_score > WORLD_RECORD:
    print("I broke the world record!")

elif my_score == WORLD_RECORD:
    print("I matched the world record!")

elif my_score > WORLD_RECORD - 5:
    print("I am near the world record!")

else:
    print("Nothing to see here.")

```


## ðŸ’ª Exercise 1

We have three timing gates. We want to know if an athlete has accelerated, decelerated, or kept a constant speed between gates 1-2 and gates 2-3.

Write a function with the following signature and docstring:

```
def compare_speed(time1, time2, time3, distance12, distance23):
    """
    Check if an athlete accelerated or decelerated based on timing gates.

    Parameters
    ----------
    time1, time2, time3 : float
        Time at which the athlete passed through timing gate 1, 2, 3,
        in seconds.
    distance12, distance23 : float
        Distance between timing gates 1 and 2; and between timing gates
        2 and 3.

    Returns
    -------
    str
        Returns "accelerated", "decelerated", or "kept constant" according
        to the calculation.

    """
```


```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [hide-cell]


def compare_speed(time1, time2, time3, distance12, distance23):
    """
    Check if an athlete accelerated or decelerated based on timing gates.

    Parameters
    ----------
    time1, time2, time3 : float
        Time at which the athlete passed through timing gate 1, 2, 3,
        in seconds.
    distance12, distance23 : float
        Distance between timing gates 1 and 2; and between timing gates
        2 and 3.

    Returns
    -------
    str
        Returns "accelerated", "decelerated", or "kept constant" according
        to the calculation.

    """
    speed1 = distance12 / (time2 - time1)
    speed2 = distance23 / (time3 - time2)

    if speed2 > speed1:
        return "accelerated"
    
    elif speed2 < speed1:
        return "decelerated"

    else:
        return "kept constant"


# Test the function:
print(compare_speed(1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 50, 50))
print(compare_speed(1.0, 2.0, 3.5, 50, 50))
print(compare_speed(1.0, 2.0, 2.5, 50, 50))

```


## ðŸ“„ Boolean operators

We can construct complex comparisons by combining the results of many comparisons, using the logical operators `not`, `and` and `or`. These operators are specifically aimed to compare booleans.

The `not` operator inverts the value of a `bool`:
```{code-cell}
not True
```

```{code-cell}
not False
```

The `or` operator yields `True` as long as one of the two operands is True:

```{code-cell}
True or False
```

```{code-cell}
False or False
```

The `and` operator yields `True` if both operands are True:

```{code-cell}
True and False
```

```{code-cell}
True and True
```

Using these operators, we can construct more complex comparisons and program flows, such as this example:

```{code-cell}
def is_between(a, lower, upper):
    """Returns True if a is strictly between lower and upper."""
    return (a > lower) and (a < upper)


# Test the function
print(is_between(3, 2, 5))
print(is_between(10, 2, 5))
print(is_between(2, 2, 5))
```

:::{good-practice} Naming functions that return bools
For clarity, functions that return booleans often start with `is_`, `has_`, `contains_`, etc.

## ðŸ’ª Exercise 2

Write a short code that checks the value of two integers named `dice1` and `dice2`, and that prints "You got double-six!", "You got one six!" or "You got no six." according to the dice values.

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [hide-cell]

# Assign some values to dice1 and dice2
dice1 = 6
dice2 = 4

if (dice1 == 6) and (dice2 == 6):
    print("You got double-six!")
elif (dice1 == 6) or (dice2 == 6):
    print("You got one six!")
else:
    print("You got no six.")
```
