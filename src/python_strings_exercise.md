# ðŸ’ª Exercise

#todo add f-strings and long strings

Create a code that creates the variable `str` in such a way that `print(str)` gives:

a)

    I won't have difficulty solving this problem.

b)

    Centre of mass of the "arm + forearm" segment.

c)

    Measured force: 150 N
    Measured moment: 34 Nm

d)

    I received this strange message:
    "ValueError('C:\temp unfound')"

Try different ways to create each variable.

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [hide-cell]

# a)

str = "I won't have difficulty solving this problem."

# b)

str = 'Centre of mass of the "arm + forearm" segment.'

# c)

str = "Measured force: 150 N\nMeasured moment: 34 Nm"

# d) (some examples):

str = "I received this strange message:\n\"ValueError('C:\\temp unfound')\""

str = 'I received this strange message:\n"ValueError(\'C:\\temp unfound\')"'

str = '''I received this strange message:
"ValueError('C:\\temp unfound')"'''
```
