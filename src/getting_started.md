# Getting started

Kinetics Toolkit is a Python package and a manual to learn how to analyze biomechanical data in Python. It requires no prior experience in programming as the manual covers everything from installing a Python distribution to performing tridimensional analyses on time-varying data.

This whole project is in constant progress, but it is stable enough to be used in most biomechanical analyses on rigid bodies. See how you can [contribute](dev_contributing.md) to this project.

Depending on your background, you may want to start your journey through this website at different points:

::::{grid}

:::{grid-item-card} I never programmed using Python.
No problem, simply start at the [beginning](installing.md).
:::

:::{grid-item-card} I know Python, Numpy and Matplotlib, but I'm new to biomechanical analysis.
You may be interested to do a refresh by attempting these different [programming_exercises](exercises.md). Then, you can go on with using the kineticstoolkit package, starting with [](timeseries.md).

:::{grid-item-card} I already do biomechanical analysis, but under Matlab instead of Python.
You may want to start at the [beginning](installing.md) to know the Python syntax. You may want to skip [](matplotlib.md) as this is practically identical to Matlab, but be sure to go through [](numpy.md) as there are lots similarities but also fundamental differences between Matlab and NumPy. Then, you can go on with using the kineticstoolkit package, starting with [](timeseries.md).

:::{grid-item-card} I already do biomechanical analysis under Python.
Great, then you may want to understand what Kinetics Toolkit could add to your Python workflow. Start directly with [](timeseries.md). You can also already jump to the [API reference](api_reference.md).
