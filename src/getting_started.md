# Chapter 1. Getting started

Kinetics Toolkit is a Python package and a manual to learn how to analyze biomechanical data in Python. It requires no prior experience in programming as the manual covers everything from installing a Python distribution to performing tridimensional analyses on time-varying data.

This whole project is in constant progress, but it is stable enough to be used in most biomechanical analyses on rigid bodies. See how you can [contribute](dev_contributing.md) to this project.

Depending on your background, you may want to start your journey through this website at different points:

:::::{tab-set}

::::{tab-item} I never programmed using Python.
:::{card}
Simply start at the [beginning](getting_started_installing.md).
:::
::::

::::{tab-item} I know Python, Numpy and Matplotlib, but I'm new to biomechanical analysis.
:::{card}
You may be interested to do a refresh by attempting these different [programming exercises](exercises.md).

Then, you can go on with using the kineticstoolkit package, starting with [](timeseries.md).
:::
::::

::::{tab-item} I already do biomechanical analysis, but under Matlab instead of Python.
:::{card}
You may want to start at the [beginning](getting_started_installing.md) to know the Python syntax.

You may skip [](matplotlib.md) as this is practically identical to Matlab, but be sure to go through [](numpy.md) as there are lots similarities but also fundamental differences between Matlab and NumPy.

Then, you can go on with using the kineticstoolkit package, starting with [](timeseries.md).
:::
::::

::::{tab-item} I already do biomechanical analysis under Python.
Great, then you may want to understand what Kinetics Toolkit could add to your Python workflow.
:::{card}
Start directly with [](timeseries.md).

You can also already jump to the [API reference](api_reference.md).
