# ðŸ“– TimeSeries

:::{card} Summary
The [TimeSeries](api/ktk.TimeSeries.rst) class is used in most Kinetic Toolkit's modules and is the only class that users have to learn in addition to python standard types and numpy arrays.

The three roles of the TimeSeries class are to:

1. organize multidimensional data in time;
2. manage events;
3. associate metadata to data.

The following sections show how to work with TimeSeries, and explain their relations with numpy arrays and pandas DataFrames.
