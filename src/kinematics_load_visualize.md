# Reading and visualizing marker trajectories

In this tutorial, we will visualize the kinematics of an athlete who propelled a racing wheelchair on a training roller during 10 seconds. In this acquisition, the marker trajectories were saved as a `c3d` file.

```{code-cell} ipython3
import kineticstoolkit.lab as ktk
```

## Reading marker trajectories

The [kinematics](api/kineticstoolkit.kinematics.rst) module provide the functions [kinematics.read_c3d_file()](api/kineticstoolkit.kinematics.read_c3d_file.rst) and [kinematics.read_n3d_file()](api/kineticstoolkit.kinematics.read_n3d_file.rst) to read files generated by common motion capture devices.

For example:

```{code-cell} ipython3
markers = ktk.kinematics.read_c3d_file(
    ktk.doc.download("kinematics_racing_full.c3d")
)

markers
```

We see that this acquisition has 46 markers. Each data key corresponds to the trajectory of one marker:

```{code-cell} ipython3
markers.data
```

## Visualizing the markers

Now we'll take a look at this acquisition using [ktk.Player](api/kineticstoolkit.Player.rst), a matplotlib-based interactive user interface aimed at visualizing markers, rigid bodies and segments in three dimensions.

For the `Player` class to be interactive, you must select an interactive backend for IPython. See the [installation section](ktk_installing.md)]] for more information. For non-interactive environments such as Jupyter lab or notebooks, it is also possible to set a point of view and generate a fixed animation. This is what we will do in these tutorials.

Set a point of view:

```{code-cell} ipython3
viewing_options = {
    "zoom": 3.5,
    "azimuth": 0.8,
    "elevation": 0.16,
    "translation": (0.2, -0.7),
}
```

Visualize the markers (note that the call to `to_html5` is only required in inline matplotlib environments such as Jupyter lab or notebooks):

```{code-cell} ipython3
player = ktk.Player(markers, **viewing_options)

player.to_html5(
    start_time=0, stop_time=1
)  # Show only one second of acquisition
```

Note the colored global reference frame on the bottom. This reference frame and every other (as we will create in the next tutorial) follow the same standard color scheme:

- x = Red
- y = Green
- z = Blue

## Interconnecting the markers

To ease the visualization, it is often practical to interconnect markers with lines. Here, we will create links between the right arm markers and between the right forearm markers.

```{code-cell} ipython3
interconnections = dict()  # Will contain all segment definitions

# Right arm
interconnections["ArmR"] = {
    # Segment color in [red, green, blue] (each between 0 et 1)
    "Color": [1, 0.25, 0],
    # List of links, defined by marker names
    "Links": [
        ["AcromionR", "MedialEpicondyleR"],
        ["AcromionR", "LateralEpicondyleR"],
        ["AcromionR", "OlecraneR"],
    ],
}

# Right forearm
interconnections["ForearmR"] = {
    "Color": [1, 0.5, 0],
    "Links": [
        ["MedialEpicondyleR", "RadialStyloidR"],
        ["MedialEpicondyleR", "UlnarStyloidR"],
        ["LateralEpicondyleR", "RadialStyloidR"],
        ["LateralEpicondyleR", "UlnarStyloidR"],
        ["OlecraneR", "RadialStyloidR"],
        ["OlecraneR", "UlnarStyloidR"],
        ["UlnarStyloidR", "RadialStyloidR"],
    ],
}
```

Now we can load a Player again with the segments we just defined:

```{code-cell} ipython3
player = ktk.Player(
    markers, interconnections=interconnections, **viewing_options
)

player.to_html5(
    start_time=0, stop_time=1
)  # Show only one second of acquisition
```
