# Getting started

Depending on your background, you may want to start your journey on this website at different points.

- Start [here](python.md) if you never programmed using Python.
- Start [here](ktk_installing.md) if you already know Python and want to learn how to use Kinetics Toolkit to perform biomechanical analyses.

At this point, the `kineticstoolkit` Python package is fairly well advanced, but the [](python_biomechanics_intro.md) section is still in heavy development. Suggestions and discussions are highly appreciated. Please see [how you can contribute with ideas and points of view](dev_contributing.md).
