# ðŸ’ª Exercise 2

Based on the function `print_info` that you created in a previous example, create a new function `format_info` that, instead of printing the information, creates an equivalent string and returns it, so that:

```
print(format_info(1, "Catherina", "Smith", 20, 1.5, 50.2))
```
    
prints this:

    =============
    Participant 1: Catherina Smith
    20 years old
    Height: 1.5 m
    Weight: 50.2 kg
    BMI: 22.31
    =============

Instead of calculating the BMI manually in the function, use a call to the `calculate_bmi` function that you just wrote in the previous example.

:::{tip}
You may want to return to the section on [strings](python_strings.md) for a refresh on how to create long strings, f-strings, and how to add line breaks in strings.

def format_info(i_participant, first_name, last_name, age, height, weight):

    output = (
        "=============\n"
        f"Participant {i_participant}: {first_name} {last_name}\n"
        f"{age} years old\n"
        f"Height: {height} m\n"
        f"Weight: {weight} kg\n"
        f"BMI: {calculate_bmi(height, weight):.2f}\n"
        "============="
    )
    return output


print(format_info(1, "Catherina", "Smith", 20, 1.5, 50.2))

```
