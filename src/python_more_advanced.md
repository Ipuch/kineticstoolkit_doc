:::{admonition} tip
In the console, you don't even have to use the `print` function to print the content of a variable or the result of an operation. You could simply write

```
"Hello world"
```

and it would produce a similar output. In general, we use the `print` function inside programs that print something, and we tend to simply enter statements directly in the console, without `print`, for working faster and quickly seing the result of an operation.
