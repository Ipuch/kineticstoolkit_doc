# Manual

## Prerequisites

The following manual assumes you already have a working scientific python environment installed (e.g., Anaconda, miniconda), and that you know the following concepts:

- Python: standard types, functions, conditions, loops, good programming practices.
- NumPy: arrays
- Matplotlib: pyplot functions (plot, xlabel, ylabel, title, etc.)
- Pandas: basic knowledge of DataFrames.

If this is not the case, then please switch to [](python_for_beginners.md) before continuing.
