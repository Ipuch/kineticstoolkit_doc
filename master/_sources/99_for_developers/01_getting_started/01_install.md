# Installing from git-hub

To help developping Kinetics Toolkits by testing it or extending it, you can install it directly from git-hub. Although you can install and use Kinetics Toolkit directly from the git-hub repository, you need additional modules to develop it.

## Install the development requirements

For this step, I advise to create an environment such as the one we use [at our lab](https://github.com/felixchenier/mosa).

## Install Kinetics Toolkit's development version

One you installed the `mosa` environment described in the link above, you can install the development version of Kinetics Tookit:

1. Clone the git repository: `git clone https://github.com/felixchenier/kineticstoolkit.git kineticstoolkit`

2. Add the `kineticstoolkit` folder to your PYTHON_PATH according to your favourite IDE and python installation.
